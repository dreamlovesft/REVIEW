\section{Introduction}
Cancer is one of the diseases with high mortality and threatens public health worldwide\cite{siegel2019cancer}. Still, the contributing cause of cancer is vague for people, exogenous ( habits and customs\cite{nascentes2019social,tian2019long,kaiser2019evolving}, biological infection factors\cite{ISI:000393734100009,liu2019cerna,anampa2020human} )  and endogenous factors ( hormones\cite{nagashima2019genome,ando2019obesity},heredity\cite{wang2019statistical,roberts2019role}) have the potential to trigger tumorigenesis or some gene mutations. In order to explore the pathogenesis of cancer and  fight the disease,  increasing attention has been focused on the field. Furthermore, blood analysis , computer-aided detection, computed tomography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) are performed  popularly techniques in clinical practice\cite{bach2012benefits,pickhardt2011colorectal,lee2019contrast,hewitson2007screening}. However, these methods are time-intensive and require expensive equipment, typically operated by experienced analytical manipulator. Besides, physical radiation or human intrusion usually occurs during the detection of these methods, which poses a hazard to public health. Additionally,  due to limitations of imaging analysis, cancers are difficult to be detected at an early stage in most cases. Therefore, more researchers are devoted into the study of biomarkers since it shows the unrivalled advantage of traditional methods in the early diagnosis of cancers\cite{schwarzenbach2011cell,reis2010alterations}. Further, proper selection of biomarkers plays an important role in biomedical research especially early diagnosis of cancer.

MicroRNAs are generally consist of  18-22 nucleotides and cannot be further translated into protein.Also, it playsã€‚3 a significant role in developmental timing, cell death, cell proliferation, haematopoiesis and patterning of the nervous system \cite{ambros2004functions,bartel2004micrornas}. In addition, it has been demonstrated that miRNAs are closely associated with the occurrence and development of tumors\cite{zhang2007micrornas,zhao2013microrna,he2007guardian,kent2006small}. All these findings suggest that miRNAs could be used as molecular biomarkers for diagnosis of cancer and prediction of prognosis\cite{luo2011microrna,herreros2019plasma}. However, high-throughput capture, enrichment, and quantitative analysis of miRNAs  still  remain a challenge. Nowadays, the popular methons include but are not limited to electrochemical detection\cite{masud2019nanoarchitecture},quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, surface-enhanced Raman  technologies\cite{lee2019quantitative}.

Recently, microfluidic technologies have shown great promise in enhancing biotechnology applications with small sample volumes, short reaction times, parallelization and fluid handling at sample-related scales\cite{RIORDON2019310}. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that microfluidics  efficiently performs a wide range of functions in biotechnology researches, such as cell manipulation\cite{yun2013cell,gao2019recent,wang2011enhanced,mu2013microfluidics}, DNA and RNA amplification \& sequencing\cite{giuffrida2017integration,chang2013nucleic,liu2019bacterial}, drug screening\cite{mitxelena2019improved,shang2019microfluidic}. It is clear that microfluidic technology has provided tools that can open up new and exciting research directions in the biological field.

%%\paragraph{This is the next level heading.~~} For this level please use \texttt{\textbackslash paragraph}. These headings should also end in a full point.

%\section{Graphics and tables}
%\subsection{Graphics}
%Graphics should be inserted on the page where they are first mentioned (unless they are equations, which appear in the flow of the text).\cite{Cotton1999}

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\centering
  %\caption{An example figure caption \textendash\ the image is from the \textit{Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics} cover gallery.}
  %\label{fgr:example}
%\end{figure}

%%\begin{figure*}
 %%\centering
 %%\includegraphics[height=3cm]{example2}
 %%\caption{An image from the \textit{Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics} cover gallery, set as a two-column figure.}
 %%\label{fgr:example2col}
%%\end{figure*}

%\subsection{Tables}
%%Tables typeset in RSC house style do not include vertical lines. Table footnote symbols are lower-case italic letters and are typeset at the bottom of the table. Table captions do not end in a full point.\cite{Arduengo1992,Eisenstein2005}


%\begin{table}[h]
%\small
  %\caption{\ An example of a caption to accompany a table}
  %\label{tbl:example}
  %\begin{tabular*}{0.48\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\f%ill}}lll}
   % \hline
   %% Header one (units) & Header two & Header three %\\
    %%%1 & 2 & 3 \\
    %%4 & 5 & 6 \\
    %%7 & 8 & 9 \\
    %%10 & 11 & 12 \\
    %%\hline
  %%\end{tabular*}
%%\end{table}

%Adding notes to tables can be complicated.  Perhaps the easiest method is to generate these manually.\footnote[4]{Footnotes should appear here. These might include comments relevant to but not central to the matter under discussion, limited experimental and spectral data, and crystallographic data.}

%%\section{Equations}

%%Equations can be typeset inline \textit{e.g.}\ $ y = mx + c$ or displayed with and without numbers:

 %%\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

%%\begin{equation}
  %\frac{\gamma}{\epsilon x} r^2 = 2r
%%\end{equation}

%You can also put lists into the text. You can have bulleted or numbered lists of almost any kind. 
%The \texttt{mhchem} package can also be used so that formulae are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash ce\{H2SO4\}} gives \ce{H2SO4}. 

%For footnotes in the main text of the article please number the footnotes to avoid duplicate symbols. \textit{e.g.}\ \texttt{\textbackslash footnote[num]\{your text\}}. The corresponding author $\ast$ counts as footnote 1, ESI as footnote 2, \textit{e.g.}\ if there is no ESI, please start at [num]=[2], if ESI is cited in the title please start at [num]=[3] \textit{etc.} Please also cite the ESI within the main body of the text using \dag.

\section{Conclusions}
The conclusions section should come in this section at the end of the article, before the Conflicts of interest statement.

\section*{Conflicts of interest}
There is no interest conflicts.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
The Acknowledgements come at the end of an article after Conflicts of interest and before the Notes and references.
